i failed misrabely so enup using text classifier for now

i have another idea tho

what if i map numbers to function and 
then make Y as list 

in dataset X will be text 

and Y will be function to execute and order


let's say i mapped 

images.capture_screenshot : 1
clip.copy : 2
clip.save : 3
browser.search: 4

and X is  

copy text from clipboard and google it 

Y will be 

[2,4]

and if reverse the sentence then Y will be 4,2 

i hope i will be able to use regression to output 2,4 and 4,2 based on tokenized X, and i can use L1 regularisation so that way my filler words suh ahhh sooo broo can you please etc... will be dropped. 
kind of multitarget regression. 

the problem is , this is task of classification but at the core it is regression and coated with contex. 

my current ape brain in not capable to think of idea which can work. 

or maybe my ideas are working just given dataset size (30 samples) model is not able to make any correlations.
