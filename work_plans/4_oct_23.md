everythign works , model is dynamic 
and it will work definatly in dynamic re ordering

but i need to make more dataset

possibly 800 sentences for 13 functions is better
and if i can get 800 senteces then model will be able to understand contex without errors


i need someone as contributor because making dataset is booring.


for:

13 functions including combinations

concept testing: 200 senteces
good dataset: 900 senteces
ideal dataset : 1500 sentences
best: 5000 dataset 

GOLD: 100000 sentences 


for each count(seq): input usig amount of functions
for ex: input using only 1 or 2 or 3 or 4

limit it to 10 functions par input

i will need 300 - 500 samples each seq

today start working again , this time we will need to improve model to perfection
but in order to do that i will need huge dataset

so today create feature plans
