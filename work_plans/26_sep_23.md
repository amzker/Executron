Today plan is to rebase entire code structure and remove hard coded rules

i will make every module as litrally collection of functions which are independednt
and then i will train model which will decide which function to execute ,

this will allow more dynamic control and less rules creation 
also code can be clean and easy to understand.

work:

- model arch plan that how i am going to approch this problem
- code rebase: dont forget to change functions such way that one can be called after other
and so like they can work individually but also as link , thus making sure that it must return something. 

for ex: 
"take a screenshot and copy it to clipboard and then open telegram"

clipboard.copy_image_to_clipboard(screenshot.screenshot())
open.application()

now in open.application i can have few rules, or input which takes place like
open.application(application_name) , if this is there then i will need to make other model which can look package name or exe name and then start it kind of 
app execution finder. this can be done without rules

open module will have function such as
open.application
open.url

which can be given to model in training portion, so before i make initial model build i must complete this.



model:

for now i can use CTC for text classification as training ( because training on speech is outof my hardware capacity ) 
which will output order of function to execute. 

when i will get access to proper hardware we can directly train CTC on speech to classify execution. this will speed
up process.
